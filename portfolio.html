                <p>
                    I am an aspiring software engineer with proven management, problem-solving, 
                    and creative skills aiming to leverage these to successfully graduate from 
                    Make School with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Frequently praised as 
                    detail-oriented by my peers, I can be relied upon to be diligent and 
                    hard-working throughout the course of this program.
